## Description

My homework project for the week was to build a Express note taking app. The app allows users to save, view and delete notes using the express module for node to act as a backend. We were provided all of the front-end HTML and JS, the rest was up to us. I found figuring out how to delete notes while keeping the Unique ID's consistent to be the biggest hurdle.
